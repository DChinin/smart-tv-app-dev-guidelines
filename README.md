## Deployment and Testing

### Samsung

(_TO-DO_)

### LG

#### Real TV

[LG Deployment official documentation](http://developer.lgappstv.com/TV_HELP/index.jsp?topic=%2Flge.tvsdk.testing.book%2Fhtml%2FRealTV%2FDeploying+and+Testing+App+on+Real+TV%2FDeploying+and+Testing+App+on+Real+TV.htm)

Use the "Export App Test" option in the LG IDE and upload the package to the "App Test" option in the LG Developer site and download the DRM applied file. You create lgapps/installed/{appid} folder structure inside a usb stick, unzip the downloaded file into it and insert the usb stick into the LG TV.

When you upload the web app into the LG Developer site, you have to insert an URL in the form. This is really good, because it means that you don't have to go over this process every time you change something in your app.

So, I just create and upload a package that allows the TV to connect to my web server. After that I can continue/start to code the app and instantly test on the real device by reloading the TV app.

#### Emulator

[LG Testing on Emulator official documentation](http://developer.lgappstv.com/TV_HELP/index.jsp?topic=%2Flge.tvsdk.testing.book%2Fhtml%2FEmulator%2FTesting+App+on+Emulator%2FTesting+App+on+Emulator.htm)
